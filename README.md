# Hangman-game
A sleek, text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game built with Python. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like state management, user input validation, and conditional game logic.
🎮 Features
1.Word Bank with Clues: Includes a predefined dictionary of programming terms, each paired with a helpful hint.

2.Hint System: Players can trade 2 attempts to automatically reveal a hidden letter.

3.Smart Validation: Prevents duplicate guesses and handles invalid inputs (numbers/symbols) without crashing.

4.Dynamic Word Display: Real-time updates of the word progress and remaining lives.

🛠️ Concepts Covered
1.Data Structures: Using Dictionaries for word-clue pairs and Lists for tracking guesses.

2.Control Flow: While loops for the game engine and if-else blocks for win/loss conditions.

3.Randomization: Utilizing the random module for unpredictable gameplay.

4.List Comprehensions: Efficiently filtering remaining letters for the hint logic.

🚀 How to Play
1.Ensure you have Python installed.

2.Run the script: python hangman.py.

3.Read the clue and guess letters one by one.

4.If you're stuck, type hint (costs 2 lives).

5.Win by completing the word before your 6 attempts run out!
